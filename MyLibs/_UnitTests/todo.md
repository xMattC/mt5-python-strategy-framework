# Unit Testing â€“ Work in Progress

> **Note:** Unit tests for this library are **not yet implemented**, but are planned.

While MetaTrader 5 (MQL5) does not natively support a formal unit testing framework, the goal of writing automated tests to:
- Verify correctness
- Support ongoing development
- Ensure long-term maintainability

This directory is intended to hold future test scripts that validate core components (e.g. position sizing, stop loss logic, and indicator handling) using **script-based test runners** and **mockable components**.
